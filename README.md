# scripts
These are simple scripts that I find useful from either the OSX command line or Linux command line.

There may be some Windows cli scripts at times, too, as there is a Legacy Problem in my professional life :).
 
NB: There probably won't be a lot of scripts here as many I use are work-related and therefore not published publicly due to Reasons.
